autoRedTeam
by: Kirk Hayes (l0gan)

autoRedTeam is a set of scripts that is designed to be placed on a device you can leave on site (or run on your laptop)
that will perform Red Team actions.

USE:
python autoRedTeam.py

sniffer.sh - Sniffer used in gathering information used to set your IP address, keeping you under the radar.
ipGen.py - Runs sniffer.sh to sniff the network and find out the IP addressing scheme. It then randomizes your MAC address, hostname, and sets your IP statically based on the subnet.
shareParser.py - Looks on the network for open NFS shares, then attempts to find sensitive data in those shares.
