autoRedTeam
by: Kirk Hayes (l0gan)

autoRedTeam is a set of scripts that is designed to be placed on a device you can leave on site (or run on your laptop) 
that will perform Red Team actions and gain you access without you needing to be there. Eventually I may make a device
that you can leave on site, come back at a later time, and you have DA privileges. (Based on idea by Kevin Robertson)

autoRedTeam.py - Main script to run
USE:
python autoRedTeam.py

sniffer.sh - Sniffer used in gathering information used to set your IP address, keeping you under the radar.
